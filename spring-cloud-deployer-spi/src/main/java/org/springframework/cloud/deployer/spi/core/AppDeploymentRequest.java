/**
 * Representation of an app deployment request. This includes the
 * {@link AppDefinition}, the {@link Resource} representing its deployable
 * artifact, and any deployment properties.
 *
 * Deployment properties are related to a specific implementation of the SPI
 * and will never be passed into an app itself. For example, a runtime container
 * may allow the definition of various settings for a context where the actual
 * app is executed, such as allowed memory, cpu or simply a way to define
 * colocation like node labeling.
 *
 * For passing properties into the app itself, use {@link AppDefinition#getProperties()}.
 * Those could be passed as env vars, or whatever approach is best for the target
 * platform. Each deployer implementation should clearly document how it handles
 * these properties.
 *
 * For passing command line arguments into the app itself, use {@link #commandlineArguments}.
