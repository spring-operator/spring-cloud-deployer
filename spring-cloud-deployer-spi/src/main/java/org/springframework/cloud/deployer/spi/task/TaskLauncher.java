 * SPI defining a runtime environment capable of launching and managing the
 * lifecycle of tasks. The term 'task' in the context of a {@code TaskLauncher}
 * is merely a runtime representation of a container or application wherein the
 * task should be executed.
 *
 * The SPI itself doesn't expect the launcher to keep state of launched tasks,
 * meaning it doesn't need to reconstruct all existing {@link TaskStatus}es or
 * the IDs needed to resolve a {@link TaskStatus}. The responsibility for
 * keeping track of the state of all existing tasks lies to whomever is using
 * this SPI. It is unrealistic to expect the launcher to be able to store enough
 * information using the underlying infrastructure to reconstruct the full
 * history of task executions.
